This is the DeployToAzure project.

It is a command-line tool that the we use on my team for Command-Line deployments of our Windows Azure applications.

We decided to make it available for anyone to use.  Let us know if you use it and see any changes needed for it.

It should be easy to build and run unit tests.  Let us know if you run into any problems.

The DeployToAzure.ps1 file provides some simple helpers around the DeployToAzure.exe.
